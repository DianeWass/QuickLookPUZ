# QuickLookPUZ
Mac QuickLook plugin to view crossword puzzle files (puz).

After opening the .dmg file, the QuickLookPUZ.qlgenerator file needs to be copied into your ~/Library/QuickLook folder.

This has been tested on Mac OS 10.8 (Mountain Lion), 10.9 (Mavericks), 10.11 (El Capitan), and 10.12 (Sierra).
